# IFRS Financial Statement Preparation App

## 1. Purpose

Cheetah Reporter is a powerful, intuitive, and customizable web-based application that provides accountants, auditors, and finance professionals with comprehensive tools for preparing IFRS-compliant financial statements. The application automates the tedious aspects of report generation, from data import to final output, while offering deep customization and collaboration capabilities to meet specific reporting needs for both Full IFRS and IFRS for SMEs.

## 3. Current Tech Stack

### Frontend Framework
**React** (built with Vite for fast development). The component-based architecture effectively manages the complexity of the financial reporting UI.

### Styling
**Tailwind CSS** provides a utility-first, highly customizable design system. **shadcn/ui** delivers pre-built, accessible components (modals, buttons, inputs) and **Lucide React** supplies the icon library.

### State Management
**Zustand** - A simple, fast, and scalable state management solution that manages global state including current project data, trial balance, and UI settings (theme, collaboration state).

### Database / Backend
**Firebase (Firestore)** - Handles user authentication, collaborative features, and stores all project data, including trial balances, mappings, custom disclosures, and generated reports. Powers the "save" and "roll forward" features.

### Data Import
**PapaParse** library provides robust in-browser CSV file parsing capabilities.

### PDF Generation
**jsPDF** and **html2canvas** - html2canvas captures the styled HTML preview pane, and jsPDF converts the capture into multi-page PDF documents, ensuring the PDF matches the preview exactly.
