# IFRS Financial Statement Preparation App

## 1. Purpose

To provide accountants, auditors, and finance professionals with a powerful, intuitive, and customizable web-based application for preparing IFRS-compliant financial statements. The app aims to automate the tedious aspects of report generation, from data import to final output, while offering deep customization and collaboration to meet specific reporting needs for both Full IFRS and IFRS for SMEs.

## 2. Core Features

### Dual IFRS Standards
Select between "Full IFRS" or "IFRS for SMEs" at the project level, with corresponding disclosure checklists.

### Trial Balance Management
- Import trial balance (TB) from CSV files
- Intuitive interface to map TB accounts to financial statement line items
- Validate TB (debits must equal credits)

### Statement Generation
Automatically generate drafts of:
- Statement of Financial Position
- Statement of Profit or Loss and Other Comprehensive Income
- Statement of Changes in Equity
- Statement of Cash Flows (Indirect Method)

### Dynamic Disclosure Engine
- Select required disclosures from a comprehensive checklist
- Edit the text and tables within standard disclosures
- Create and insert fully custom notes with a rich text editor and table builder

### Report Preview & Export
- Live, paginated HTML preview that mirrors the final document
- One-click PDF export of the complete, professionally formatted financial statements

### Period-End Workflow
- Save and manage multiple reporting projects
- "Roll Forward" feature to carry closing balances from one period to the next as comparative figures

### Modern UI/UX
- Default dark mode for comfortable viewing
- Easy-to-use theme toggle for switching to light mode
- Fully responsive design for use on any device

## 3. Proposed Tech Stack

### Frontend Framework
**React** (using Vite for a fast development environment). Its component-based architecture is ideal for managing the complexity of the UI.

### Styling
**Tailwind CSS** for a utility-first, highly customizable design system. Complemented by **shadcn/ui** for pre-built, accessible components (like modals, buttons, inputs) and **Lucide React** for icons.

### State Management
**Zustand** - A simple, fast, and scalable state management solution perfect for managing global state like the current project data, trial balance, and UI settings (e.g., theme).

### Database / Backend
**Firebase (Firestore)** - For user authentication, collaborative features, and storing all project data, including trial balances, mappings, custom disclosures, and generated reports. This enables the "save" and "roll forward" features.

### Data Import
**PapaParse** library for robust in-browser CSV file parsing.

### PDF Generation
**jsPDF** and **html2canvas** - html2canvas will capture the styled HTML preview pane, and jsPDF will convert that capture into a multi-page PDF document, ensuring the PDF looks exactly like the preview.

## 4. App Architecture & Page Descriptions

The application will be a Single Page Application (SPA) with different views rendered based on the user's navigation.

### Page 1: Dashboard / Home

### Project Setup
You are to build a React application using Vite, Tailwind CSS, Zustand, and Firebase.

**Initial Setup Commands:**
```bash
npm create vite@latest cheetah-reporter -- --template react-ts
cd cheetah-reporter
npm install
npm install @tailwindcss/forms @tailwindcss/typography
npm install zustand firebase
npm install @radix-ui/react-dialog @radix-ui/react-dropdown-menu
npm install lucide-react react-hook-form papaparse
npm install jspdf html2canvas
```

### Firebase/Firestore Data Model (Updated)

#### `projects` collection:
```javascript
{
  companyName: string,
  reportingDate: timestamp,
  ifrsStandard: 'full' | 'sme',
  collaborators: { [userId: string]: 'admin' | 'editor' | 'viewer' },
  trialBalance: { rawData: object[], mappings: object },
  notes: { [noteId: string]: { content: string, order: number } },
  // ...etc
}
```

#### Sub-collections within each project document:
- **`audit_trail`:** Documents with fields userId, timestamp, action, details
- **`comments`:** Documents with fields elementId, threadId, userId, text, status

#### `templates` collection:
To store user-generated templates.

### Component Structure (Updated)

Add components for new features:
- **`features/collaboration/`:** InviteUserModal.jsx, UserRolesManager.jsx
- **`features/review/`:** Comment.jsx, CommentSidebar.jsx, AuditTrailViewer.jsx

### State Management (Zustand)
- **`useProjectStore`:** Will need actions to handle real-time data from Firestore listeners for comments and audit trail entries
- **`useUIStore`:** As previously defined

### Core Logic Implementation (Updated)

- **Real-time Listeners:** Use `onSnapshot` extensively to listen for changes to the project document, as well as the comments and audit_trail sub-collections, updating the Zustand store accordingly

- **Permissions:** Before rendering any component that allows editing or performing an action, check the current user's role from `project.collaborators` to enforce permissions

- **Commenting Logic:** When a user adds a comment, create a new document in the comments sub-collection. The UI will render comments by fetching and displaying documents from this collection

- **Template Logic:** The "Save as Template" function should read the active project's structure (mappings, notes, etc.), strip out the transactional values, and save this clean structure as a new document in the templates collection

- **Algorithmic Validation Logic:** Implement comprehensive business rules for data validation, ratio analysis, and anomaly detection using mathematical algorithms and predefined thresholds
